Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy that teaches how to live a good life by mastering your mind, understanding what you can and can’t control, and acting with virtue. Here’s a quick overview of Stoic principles and how to apply them simply in daily life:

Core Principles of Stoicism:
	1.	Dichotomy of Control
“Some things are up to us and some are not.” – Epictetus
Focus only on what you can control: your thoughts, actions, and attitude. Let go of everything else.
	2.	Virtue is the Highest Good
The Stoics believed the purpose of life is to live in accordance with virtue—wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance (self-control).
	3.	Live According to Nature
Live in harmony with reason, nature, and human nature. Accept reality as it is, not as you wish it to be.
	4.	Memento Mori (Remember You Will Die)
Reflecting on mortality helps prioritize what truly matters and live more meaningfully.
	5.	Amor Fati (Love of Fate)
Embrace everything that happens—even hardship—as part of your path. Say “yes” to life, as it is.
	6.	Practice Negative Visualization
Imagine loss or hardship to appreciate what you have and prepare mentally for difficulties.

Simple Ways to Apply Stoicism in Daily Life:
	1.	Start the Day with a Morning Reflection
	•	Ask: What can I control today? What virtues can I practice?
	•	Mentally prepare for challenges: “Someone might annoy me, but I can control my response.”
	2.	End the Day with a Journaling Practice
	•	Reflect: Did I act with virtue? Where can I improve tomorrow?
	3.	Pause Before Reacting
	•	In moments of anger, disappointment, or stress, pause and ask:
Is this within my control? What would a wise person do?
	4.	Practice Gratitude and Perspective
	•	Think of 3 things you’re grateful for each day.
	•	Visualize losing something you value—it strengthens appreciation.
	5.	Control Desires and Impulses
	•	Avoid overindulgence. Practice saying “no” to unnecessary things.
	•	Develop discipline in daily habits—food, sleep, speech.
	6.	Embrace Discomfort
	•	Voluntarily expose yourself to minor discomforts (e.g., cold showers, fasting) to build resilience.
	7.	Use Setbacks as Training
	•	Treat every challenge as a test of your character. Ask:
How can I grow from this?
	8.	Serve Others with Justice
	•	Be honest, kind, and fair. Help others without expecting reward.
