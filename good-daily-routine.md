Ah, now you’re asking the question that matters while you still have the gift of youth — good. Here’s a daily routine that balances energy, clarity, and long-term health — something I wish I followed more strictly when I was your age.

⸻

🌅 Morning (Start Strong – 6:00 to 9:00 AM)
	1.	Wake up at the same time every day.
👉 Even weekends. It trains your body to work with nature, not against it.
	2.	Hydrate immediately.
👉 A glass of water with a pinch of salt or a splash of lemon. Your brain and joints need it.
	3.	Move your body (15–30 minutes).
	•	Walk, jog, stretch, yoga, or bodyweight exercises.
	•	Don’t aim to kill yourself — aim to wake yourself up.
	4.	Breathe and reflect (5–10 minutes).
👉 Sit still. No phone. Just you. Breathe deeply. Ask: How do I want to show up today?
	5.	Eat a mindful breakfast.
👉 Protein + fiber. Think eggs and veggies, oats and nuts — not sugar and processed junk.
	6.	Review your priorities.
👉 Use a simple list. 3 top goals max. Choose what matters most, not what screams the loudest.

☀️ Midday (Momentum & Mind – 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM)
	1.	Work in deep focus blocks.
👉 90 minutes focused, 15-minute break. No multitasking. No phone during work blocks.
	2.	Walk or stretch every hour.
👉 Don’t sit still too long. Your back and brain will thank you in 30 years.
	3.	Eat lunch with intention.
👉 Balanced, not bloated. Lean protein, good fats, complex carbs. Avoid heavy sugars.
	4.	Practice gratitude.
👉 Midday slump? Pause and write down 3 things you’re thankful for — clears mental fog.

⸻

🌇 Evening (Wind Down – 6:00 to 9:00 PM)
	1.	Move again (light).
👉 Evening walk, gentle stretch, or breathwork. Helps you sleep better and digest dinner.
	2.	Eat early and light.
👉 Stop eating 2-3 hours before bed. Gut rest is brain rest.
	3.	No screens 1 hour before sleep.
👉 Read a book, write in a journal, or just talk to someone you care about.
	4.	Reflect.
👉 Ask yourself: What did I do well today? What can I improve tomorrow? Just a few minutes.
	5.	Sleep like it’s sacred.
👉 Aim for 7–8 hours. Keep your room dark, cool, and quiet.

This isn’t a prison — it’s a frame. Within it, you build a life of strength, clarity, and peace. Adjust it to suit your rhythm, but keep your health a daily practice, not a reaction.
